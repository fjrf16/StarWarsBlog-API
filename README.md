# INTRODUCTION

This project it has been done by creating a Backend functionality with the data models, the endpoints and the authentication by tokens for the users. Every user can select planets and characters favorites and delet it.

## Functionality

This blog has been done with Python SQLAlchemy library.

This backend functionality has been done in such a way that first of all the data tables and their methods have been defined in the `models.py` file and also the relationships between the tables.

Secondly the endpoints have been defined in the `main.py` file, where the endpoints to obtain the users, the favorites and the characters and planets have been included.

In the `main.py` file, the authentication through tokens for the registration and login of the users in the blog has also been done.

To test the code if you use gitpod you can use the following steps:

### *) How i initiate it?

1) `git clone https://github.com/fjrf16/StarWarsBlog-API.git`
2) `pipenv run start`
3) Copy the URL in Postman and test the endpoints
